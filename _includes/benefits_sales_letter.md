## Let’s be Honest...

**Nobody enjoys your membership drive.**

DJs try to call in sick. Exhausted show hosts grit their teeth and power through it. Worse, all but your most dedicated listeners tune you out.

Everyone understands that an enormous amount of your funding comes from listener support. Membership drives are so important, why do they have to be so painful?

What if there was a way to shorten your membership drive, move much of the work online, and dare we say, even make the whole thing more enjoyable?

What if you could engage with new supporters and mobilize dedicated supporters online, through email, and through social media, all through a single, easy-to-use interface?

<h3 class="highlight">MemberDrive ties together your broadcast, online, email, and social media outreach into one live, dynamic campaign.</h3>

DJs can track real-time donation income and goal progress on a beautiful, glanceable DJ dashboard. Call operators see the same information and can enter donations over the phone with just a few keystrokes.

Members and donors can easily donate online with our secure, 30-second donation checkout form. Even allow individual donors to set up their own matching funds, which they can promote to their friends through social media.

What about your existing data? Easily migrate your historical donation data, or keep your existing database and use our integration platform.

Unlike many fundraising platforms, MemberDrive is easy to use, not just for you, but also for your members and donors. Never fear that you might be losing donors at the checkout process; that doesn’t happen with MemberDrive. Don’t stress about staff training: MemberDrive is so easy to use almost everyone can pick it up and start using it right away without training. But our support team is here for you when you do need us; we never charge extra for support, and you can chat with us online, via email, or by phone.

We’ve had years of experience writing software for nonprofit organizations and charities. We've helped thousands of nonprofit organizations track and improve their relationships with their donors and supporters. We know charity, and we understand donors. <strong class="highlight">We pride ourselves on building smart, easy software that you and your donors will actually use so that you can get your mind off your software and keep your focus where it belongs: your mission.</strong>
